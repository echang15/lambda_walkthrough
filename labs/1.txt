Create an S3 Bucket

Create Execution Role that has access to S3 Bucket

Upload your favorite song's lyrics as a text file to your S3 Bucket

1. Create a Lambda function that reads the file from S3, and returns the contents

2. Create a Lambda function that reads the file, does a unique word count, and counts each word's occurences. Display them in descending order
  ie..  Metallica's Fade To Black:
  "i": 6
  "me" : 6
  "to": 5
  "will" 3
  ....

3. Create a Lambda function that does the same as Lab 2, but takes in a filename as a parameter


4. Create a Lambda function that does the same functionality, but can handle multiple files from a parameter
